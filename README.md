# BASICS FOR GO - GOLANG - GOPHER!

I created this to contain the basic functions of Go. It first came as practice for me, but am hoping it will help others out as well.

## Getting Started with GO

If you do not have Go installed then you can go to: https://golang.org/
to install, but if you're on a **MAC** you can install in terminal using the command:
`brew install go`

After this you may create your Go workspace.

To create go files in Terminal type: `touch Name_Of_File.go`

To run Go files on Terminal type: `go run name_of_file.go`

## Getting This Repository on your machine

If you're using terminal you want to type: `git clone [url]`
The "[url]" will be found inside the green button that says "clone or download". Make sure you're cloning it somewhere you can get to easily!

## Basic git commands

1.) To clone a repository to your local machine: `git clone [url]`

2.) Letting git know which files to track in repository: 
     
     -> To add all files: `git add`
     
     -> To add a singular file `git add [filepath]`

3.) Commit changes / create snapshot update: `git commit -m "[message]"`

4.) Push changes to repository: `git push`


*(Misc)*
-> Pull any changes made to repository: `git pull`

-> Remove file from repository (Make sure to commit changes): `git rm [File]`

*Thanks & I hoped this helped someone.*
