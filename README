# BASICS FOR GO - GOLANG - GOPHER!

The main.go file holds all the basic code with comments. (Sorry if it's a little hard to read).

If you do not have Go installed then you can go to: https://golang.org/
to install, but if you're on a mac if you open terming you can just
type: brew install go 
After this you can greate your go workspace.


To create go files in Terminal type: touch Name_Of_File.go


Thanks & I hoped this helped someone.

**Again sorry for the poorly formatted README I'm still messing around with stuff**
